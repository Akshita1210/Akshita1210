- 👋 Hi, I’m Akshita Kancharla, a mechatronics engineering student in India.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating an algorithm for healthcare informatics(researching) using machine learning and also I've always loved to know the logic and concept behind human psychology in personal, i'm so into changing people's mindest to no mayo, no chicken, no meat through making an effort on creating an algorithm on vegan meat, which tastes exactly like real meat. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various important programming languages, machine learning, various domains under artificial intelligence, data science and deep learning. Just because I don't know anything regarding it, it excites me in a way where I constantly try and keep learning everything and anything regarding it effectively.
